# Sample Size Calculation

The goal of this document is to provide a template in R that can calculate the sample size needed for clinical trials and other experiments based on a range of specified values and a set type l error (α), type two error (β), and statistical power (1−β). A range of the means or proportions of the treatment group of interest can be established and all sample sizes calculated, stored in a data frame, and plotted.

**Programming Language**: R | **Packages**: ggplot2, ggthemes
